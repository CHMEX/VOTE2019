# About me 
I am CHMEX a Komodo Team member and Operator of www.dexstats.info, which provides various useful tools like Trading History, Richlist & Lookup, Address Converter and PIRATE Migration & Onboarding to name a few. Visit www.dexstats.info to learn more.
I work an IT Job in Telco involving Data and Metrics.

For the first time I would like to present myself as a candidate for Notary Node Election 2019 to operate a Node in the EU region. I only run for one Region and one Node. In case of auto re-election in 2020 the proposed Use of Funds will be valid too.

I was running LP Nodes on odd pairs like DBG/HUSH HUSH/VTC. I had PIZZA/BEER LP running. Will active these Nodes again with mm2.0. My addresses have been involved in approx. 15% of all BartertDEX Atomic Swaps.
* I don't code C but some of my suggested RPC Calls have been implemented by James and Duke.

* I will continue creating Tools for the Community. **I believe in a One Operator One Node strategy.** I want to ReDesgin Dexstats and create a Bot to track KMD Reward.
* Node will be running in Switzerland ( currentlys used for LABS ) with a politically stable and Crypto Friendly Goverment. 
* I'm helping out people as much as I can on Discord and Telegram.

# Use of Funds:

* Increasing Infrastructer to all Regions.
* 10% of mined funds to LABS :microscope: ( min. 150 KMD per Month )
* 10% of mined funds to PIRATE :sailboat:	:anchor:	( min. 150 KMD per Month )
* Dedicating more time to the KMD Eco System.
* **If I get lucky to mine a big Block ( check: www.notarystats.info ) with Reward >= 500KMD I will Airdrop 67% of it to my Voters.**

If I get elected I can setup, Pay and $BUIDL for more Servers for the next wave of Assetchains in 2019/2020.
I got some Donations from Community members over the last few month which I'm very thankful. With the current Infrastructer I pay arround USD 200 per month out of my pocket.
